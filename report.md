An open source chatbot framework written in Python.

## Onboarding experience

Did you choose a new project or continue on the previous one?
> We started a new one since our last project was too small for this assignment.

If you changed the project, how did your experience differ from before?
> This project was a lot harder to start with since it didn't install properly. Some hidden requirements files and a lot of reading documentations later we managed to get it to work on most of our computers. Since the project also was bigger than our previous one, the code was more complex and therefore harder to understand.

## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in
> This assignment, more than previous assignments, we have all sat together and worked as a group than individually.
> 
> Slack has been used to communicate when we are meeting up

2. discussions within parts of the group;

4. configuration and setup;

5. analyzing code/output;

## Overall experience

What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?
> It takes a long time to learn a project, and it took way longer to find a suitable issue than we thought it was going to take. We are thankful for the people who spends their spare time working on open source projects!

How did you grow as a team, using the Essence standard to evaluate yourself?

> We find ourself almost in the "performing" category, the only thing missing is one thing from the "Formed" category, "All team members understand how to perform their work.". This is mostly because all of us in the team were confused over this assignment. Both from that we weren't sure what the TA's would think of our work, and that open source project takes a long time to get used to (and many aren't writing issues in a good manner).
